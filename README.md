# Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation for NixOS

This repository contains a `flake.nix` for building
[TWS](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/tws.php) on NixOS.

It also contains a script, `update_flake.rb`, which can be run to regenerate
the flake whenever the TWS installer is updated.

## Special Thanks

None of this would have been possible without the help of
[Rob Bassi](https://github.com/robbassi/).
